# rpcgen-multithreaded
An implementation of multi-threaded rpcgen code suitable for compiling as 
rpcgen -a -M 

Note that I'm not certain what the history behind this code is.  But since
I am required to write a multi-threaded program using rpcgen, and this seems
to be the only working example I can find on the internet, it is what I'm 
going with.  

The original author of this code "Boris Derzhavets" publised the code with
the following message...

"This message is supposed to give a positive answer for the question 23.10
from [1] Chapter "RPC". Actually code published in [1] utilizes static
variables   what causes question 23.10 from [1](about multihreaded
implementation   of RPC Server under Linux) to produce some confusion.
Originally only two files are taken from [1]: rdict.x  and rdict_srp.c. All
business logic is implemented into rdict_client.c - file generated by
command:
    $ rpcgen -a -M rdict.x
Files rdict.c and rdict_cif.c (see [1] , Chapter "RPC") are taken out to
highlight the core of RPC technology either "Sun" or "DCE"
Remember -A option of rpcgen is not supported under Linux. Library calls
providing by SunOS RPC to build Multithreaded RPC Server are unavailable 
under Linux as well. I believe that code has been developed could be very
helpful for Linux developers at this time. The example given bellow 
demonstrate the universal approach to build multithreaded RPC Severs."

I found the source of this code here...

I'm not clear as to what Chapter he is talking about or what he means 
exactly, and I'm not fully clear as to what his code is doing. But,
I am certain that he did not fully follow the spirit of rpcgen precicely 
because he actively wrote code into files which specificatlly state they 
should not be modified. 

Nonetheless, I have consolidated some of his code by moving it into the files
that rpcgen makes available for writing anyway, and I am attempting to figure
out what he did in the files that weren't supposed to be modified in an
attempt to make the code only change in the files that rpcgen say we should
change anyway.  

I don't think I will be successful in this endeavor. 

A secondary goal will be to figure out how to create additional input paramater
and return types in some of the functions.  I need to do this because my 
homework requires that I pass arrays or integers, return the contents of a 
directory, return a datetime string, and more.  Some of these things need 
to be able to handle variable size memory, strings, and such in this form of
rpc ... whichI believe under the hood is just using XDR.

Complex allocations and routines remain a significant challenge for my homework,
and if I figure them out, I won't post my homework, but I intend to at least 
demonstrate one or two of the more complex return types if I am successful. 

Any help would be appriciated here.

Also, any rights here go to the original author.  His post isn't published with 
a license, so all this code should be considered to be his copyright.
